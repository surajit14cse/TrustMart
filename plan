# E-Commerce Web Template: Design & Development Plan

## 1. Design Philosophy

The goal is to create a clean, modern, and minimalist e-commerce template. The design will be product-focused, ensuring that the items for sale are the main attraction. It will be highly responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing, leveraging modern UI/UX principles.

**Aesthetic:**
- **Layout:** Open, uncluttered, with ample white space.
- **Color Palette:** A neutral primary scheme (e.g., whites, light grays) with a single, vibrant accent color for buttons, links, and calls-to-action (CTAs).
- **Typography:** Clean, readable sans-serif fonts (e.g., Montserrat, Lato, or a standard Google Font).

## 2. Core Technologies

- **HTML5:** For semantic structure and content.
- **CSS3:** For custom styling, branding, and minor animations.
- **Bootstrap 5.3:** For the core responsive grid system, pre-styled components (navbars, buttons, cards, forms), and utility classes. This accelerates development and ensures mobile-first responsiveness.
- **Vanilla JavaScript (Optional):** For interactive elements like an image carousel on the product page or dynamic form validation, without relying on heavy frameworks.

## 3. File Structure

A clear and scalable file structure is essential.
